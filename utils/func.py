    It applies probabilistic Hough line transformation to given RGB image
    process of applying hough transformation to the image is as follows:
        - creating copy of original image,
        - then copy is converted to gray scale, 
        - later the gaussian blur filter is applied to the gray scaled image
        - on the blurred image Canny's edges detection is processed
        - on the binary image that contains the detected edges Hough transformation is processed to get lines,
            if any detected, it contains two points - both ends of line, between them we can plot strainght line

        hough_thresh (int, optional): minimum number of intersections (votes) in the accumulator to "declare" a line - the higher value the fewer lines, only strong ones. Defaults to 100.
