class CourtFinder:
    """
    This class provides functionality for detecting and locating project-relevant objects on a tennis court.

    This class is designed to locate and store intersections between court lines,
    and map them to their respective lines for further geometric or object-detection
    processing. Intersections are sorted by their vertical (Y-axis) coordinate in 
    descending order, so that higher points on the image are processed first.

    Attributes:
        img : np.ndarray
            The image (as a NumPy array) of the tennis court on which detection is performed.
        offset : int
            A pixel offset used in downstream calculations (e.g., for tolerance in matching
            or visualization).
        intersections : list[Intersection]
            A list of Intersection objects sorted from top to bottom (highest Y to lowest Y).
        line_intersection_mapping : dict[Line, set[Intersection]]
            A mapping from each court line to the set of intersections that lie on it.

        """
        Initialize the CourtFinder with intersection data, image, and offset.

        Parameters:
            intersections : list[Intersection]
                A list of intersection objects, each containing two lines and a point of intersection.
                These will be sorted by their Y coordinate in descending order (top to bottom in image space).
            img : np.ndarray
                The court image to process.
            offset : int, optional
                Pixel offset for tolerance-based calculations (default is 20).

        Notes:
            During initialization:
            - Intersections are sorted by their Y coordinate in descending order.
            - A mapping (`line_intersection_mapping`) is built to quickly find all intersections
            belonging to a given court line.
